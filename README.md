Since I've written my code on Google Colab, you just have to acess "Kaffa_Pre_qualification_test.ipynb" on this repository and click on the link  "Open in colab" to run my code. There you have to click on Runtime and then on run all, or you can just run 1 cell at a time. On this case, it's recommended to run the previous cells before, because some of the codes need some of the results provided before. Here's a GIF of me showing how to run my code.
